Some Sympy Objects Adapted to Image Manipulation

This project is born from the following insight: 

Images are more or less rectangles with energy.

This is not really a complete framework nor has any ambitious goals.

Just two three subclasses to some objects of :code:`sympy.geometry` module
that I found useful when dealing with images.

Requirements
-------------
- numpy
- sympy
